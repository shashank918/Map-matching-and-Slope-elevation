# Map matching and Slope elevation

Packages required to run the code:
Python 2.7
probe


Steps to map match probe points to road links

1) Extract zip folder

2) Open map_matching folder for calculating matched points

3) Make sure the input files in map_matching folder

4) run map_matching.py file

5) Output will be saved in output directory. 

Steps for calculating Slope and Elevation

6) Open slope_elevation folder for calculating slope and elevation

7) Keep input files in slope_elevation folder(Partition6467MatchedPoints.csv which is the output of map_matching.py is given as input to Elevation_Slope.py)

8) Run elevation_slope.py file

9) Output will be saved in output directory.
